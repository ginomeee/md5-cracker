Reversing an MD5 hash (password cracking) for Coursera
==
Reversing an MD5 hash, well not really reversing, more like brute-forcing and comparing hash files. This is the most rudimentary way of finding out a password or some hashed text.

This is a lesson in how easy it is to crack short passwords
with a limited alphabet.  While this works well to crack
very short passwords it is not practical as password
length grows.
